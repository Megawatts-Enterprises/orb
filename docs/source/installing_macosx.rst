MacOSX
------

Security on OSX can be a little overzealous. Please follow these steps carefully, in order.

- open the DMG
- drag & drop `lnorb` into the `Applications` folder
- In Spotlight (CMD Space), type lnorb
- Once lnorb appears in Spotlight, try running it
- You may be presented with the following two dialogs:

- in spotlight, type: Security and Privacy
- in the Security and Privacy screen, click "Open anyway", and "Open"
- run the lnorb application
- Orb should open

If Orb does not open:

- in stoplight type 'terminal'
- in the terminal paste
    - cd /Applications/lnorb.app/Contents/MacOS
    - ./lnorb
    - report back your issues in our tech-support group (link at top of this page)
